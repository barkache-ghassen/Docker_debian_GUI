web3challenger@dafe9e5f223d:~$ vncserver
vncserver: Could not migrate /home/web3challenger/.vnc to /home/web3challenger/.config/tigervnc.
this was an error and vnc was not able to connect to the server 
this line in start.sh 
# Fix TigerVNC migration
mkdir -p $HOME/.config/tigervnc
chown -R $USER:$USER $HOME/.config ///fixed the problem 

The VNC password is hardcoded as "password" - consider using environment variables for security
The container runs as root in the Dockerfile, but a web3challenger user is created for future use (see Notes.txt)
The TigerVNC migration fix in start.sh (lines 3-5) prevents the common VNC startup error

to run
docker build --no-cache -t debian:web3challenger .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -p 5901:5901 debian:web3challenger

user created in base image to run the container as this user uncomment the command below in the dockerfile
USER web3challenger
WORKDIR /home/web3challenger

docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash

REST TO DO : 
fixing remote resize to run while building
